General Tips for NewComers:

If you are brand new to programming here are some general tips.

1. Learn the why and how behind what is happening - This can never be overstated, when you have an error in your code that is not simply a typo try and figure out why you are getting the error. Especially type errors. Although they aren't super important to learn up front since Python is dynamically typed they will quickly become important.

2. In the beginning write programs that do one thing. - You aren't going to build the next million dollar idea when you start programming. In the beginning figure out one thing you want to do and do that. This will allow you learn in small chunks and gain an understanding of the language and programming in general in small parts.

I'll add more when I think of them.
